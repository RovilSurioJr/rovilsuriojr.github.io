## System of Linear Equations

This laboratory activity aims to implement the principles and techniques of solving linear equations using the various linear algebra techniques and to solve a system of equations using Python programming.

The practices of the activity include working around with the system of linear equations using Python programming. This activity implies and teaches the various algebra techniques in solving linear equations. Moreover, the deliverables of the activity are to provide an equation and solve it using the NumPy functions. Lastly, it was achieved by creating a scenario and represent it in a matrix then solve using Python programming and NumPy function.

The results from solving a system of linear equations from the scenario created using the linear equation and the np.linalg.solve() function from NumPy are presented in this section.

### Scenario

“I and my brother have a collection of anime figurines and I created a list for our current figurines and the one that is still currently in a pre-ordered state. In total, we currently have 6 nendoroids, 4 Figma, and 3 pop up parade. This cost us a total of 30,000. Meanwhile, the current figurines we pre-ordered that will be released in the future are 2 nendoroids, 2 figma, and 3 pop up parade, for a total of 18,000. I am still waiting for the other re-release of the figures I failed to acquire. Those are 4 nendoroids, 2 Figma, and 1 pop up parade which will be about 15,000.” 

### Matrix form

This was presented in matrix form afterward to solve it using Python programming.
