## Matrices

This laboratory activity aims to implement the principles and techniques of performing basic matrix operations, translating matrix equations and operations using Python, and to be familiar with matrices and their relation to linear equations.

The practices of the activity include translating matrix equations and performing different basic matrix operations using Python. This teaches and implies the techniques of doing operations between matrices with the use of Python and NumPy library. The deliverables of the activity are to provide a code or a function that will display all the details of a matrix that has been discussed in this laboratory and to perform operations between matrices. It was achieved by using some functions from the NumPy library such as np.shape() that returns the shape of an array [1], np.ndim() that returns the number of array dimensions [2], np.all() that test whether all array elements along a given axis evaluate to True [3], np.identity() for producing an identity array [4], np.zeros() which “return a new array of given shape and type, filled with zeros” [5], np.ones() that returns an array filled with ones [6], np.array_equal() that returns True if the two arrays have the same shape and elements and False otherwise [7], np.sum() that sum up the elements of the array over a given axis [8], np.multiply() that “Multiply arguments element-wise” [9].
