## Introduction
Linear algebra is a form of mathematics that is applied both in science in engineering because this lets us model a natural phenomenon and compute it efficiently and some basics examples of this can be seen in this blog. Also, Linear algebra concepts are very important in understanding machine learning and the theory behind it.

## What to expect?
In this blog, you will be introduced to basic programming with Python programming language and some important libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib for visualization and other things. Also, matrices and vectors are the things you will mostly deal with in these examples.
