## Linear Combination and Spans

This laboratory activity aims to implement the principles and techniques of representing linear combinations in the 2-dimensional plane. This also aims to visualize spans using vector fields in Python and to perform vector field operations using scientific programming.

The practices of the activity include combining linear scaling and the addition of a vector. This activity teaches and implies the techniques of representing linear combinations in the 2-dimensional plane and visualizing spans using vector fields in python. Some functions were used such as np.arange() function that returns evenly spaced values within a given interval [1], plt.scatter() function that makes the plotting of the x and y components of a vector into a plane faster [2], plt.axhline() and plt.axvline() functions that adds a horizontal and vertical line across the axes [3][4], np.meshgrid() function that returns coordinate matrices from coordinate vectors [5]. The deliverables of the activity are to provide a linear equation and vector form of the linear combination. It was achieved by providing random values to be used in the equations and the vector form of the linear combination.
