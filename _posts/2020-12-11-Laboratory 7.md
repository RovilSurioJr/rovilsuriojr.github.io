## Matrix Algebra

This laboratory activity aims to implement the principles and techniques of matrix operations. The student will be familiarized with the fundamental of matrix operations and learn how to apply them to solve equations.

The practices of the activity involve doing some operations between arrays and to be familiarized with it. This activity teaches and implies the techniques of some specific operations that are very vital to this course such as transposition and dot product. Meanwhile, the deliverables of this activity are to perform operations and prove the dot product properties. It was achieved by making a code with Python that will prove that the property is True.
