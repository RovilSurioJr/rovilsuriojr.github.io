## Matrix Algebra

This laboratory activity aims to implement the principles and techniques of matrix operations. The student will be familiarized with the fundamental of matrix operations and learn how to apply them to solve equations.

The practices of the activity involve doing some operations between arrays and to be familiarized with it. This activity teaches and implies the techniques of some specific operations that are very vital to this course such as transposition and dot product. Meanwhile, the deliverables of this activity are to perform operations and prove the dot product properties. It was achieved by making a code with Python that will prove that the property is True.

### Property 1 Flowchart

Figure above shows the flowchart created for proving the first property of the dot product. This property states that a dot product between A and B is not equal to the dot product between B and A.

### Property 2 Flowchart

The second property of the dot product states that a dot product between matrix A and the result of the product between matrix B and C is equal to the dot product of matrix C between a dot product result between matrix A and B.

The fourth property of the dot product states that the dot product between A and the result from the addition between B and C  is equal to the dot product between B and A added to the dot product between C and A.

The sixth property of the dot product states that when a dot product between a matrix and a null set is performed, it will result in a null set or empty set.

### Activity 7 Flowchart

The seventh property of the dot product states that in A = (n,k) and B = (k,m), the column space size on A or (k) in A must equal to row space size on B or (k) in B to be able to perform dot product between matrices.
