## Plotting Vector using NumPy and MatPlotLib

This laboratory activity aims to implement the principles and techniques of plotting a vector with the use of the MathPlot library for creating visualizations in Python and the NumPy library for fast operations on arrays.

The practices of the activity include creating arrays and plotting of vectors. This teaches and implies the techniques of manipulating arrays and plotting of vectors. The deliverables of the activity are to provide an array and formulas needed to completely plot the vectors. Lastly, it was achieved by reading the documentation of the functions.
