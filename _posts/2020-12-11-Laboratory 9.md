## Case Study

### Case

Bebang is back to consult you about her business. Furthering her data analytics initiative she asks you for help to compute some relevant data. Now she is asking you to compute and visualize her sales and costs for the past year. She has given you the datasets attached to her request.

### Problem

Bebang asked for help in knowing the monthly revenues, costs, and profits from the sale data last year provided. A CSV with prices per donut flavor and their costs was also provided by Bebang to also know the sales of each flavor for a whole year. Moreover, the deliverables of the activity are to provide a code for computing the values needed such as the monthly cost, monthly revenues, and monthly profit. Upon getting the values needed, getting the top 3 best and worst flavors can be done by sorting the data gathered. Lastly, a graph can also be provided to better visualize and analyze the data gathered to come up with an idea to improve the things that might help the business to grow more.
