## Linear Transformation

This laboratory activity aims to implement the principles and techniques of performing matrix operations or linear transformations such as repositioning, scaling, shearing, and rotation.

The practice of the activity is to perform matrix operation and visualize scaling, shearing, rotation on the given matrix using Python and NumPy. This implies and teaches the matrix operation needed to succeed in the linear transformation. The deliverables of the activity are to provide an example of linear transformation for a 2D space using the vector fields.

The result after performing a matrix operation or linear transformation specifically the repositioning of vectors is presented in this section.

### Part 1

![Figure 1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/LAB10.1.jpg)

The code snippet above shows the code created for performing linear transformation specifically repositioning of vectors. The visualization used to observe the changes that happened is a vector field because it provides a more understandable graph than using a scatter plot.

### Part 2

![Figure 2]({{site.baseurl}}/images/LAB10.2.jpg)

Figure 2 shows the visualization of the transformed vector. The direction of the arrow represents the direction of the vector and in the example above, it shows that the direction of the arrow shifted 180 degrees because the transformation done is repositioning where in this case, the opposite integer value of the original vector is the transformed version of the original vector.
