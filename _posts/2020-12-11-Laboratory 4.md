## Vector Operations

This laboratory activity aims to implement the principles and techniques of doing the operations between the vectors using Python and to visualize the vector operations.

The practices of the activity include being familiar with different operations that can be done between the array of vectors and to make functions that will solve operations following a certain formula. This also teaches and implies the techniques of doing operation between an array of vectors and visualizing the resulting vector using a 3D-plot. The deliverables of the activity are to provide a function that will solve the modulus of a vector using the Euclidean Norm formula, a function that will solve the inner product of two vectors using the inner product formula, and to code the operation of vectors given by the instructor also, explain its resulting vector using a 3D-plot. Lastly, It was achieved by implementing loops on the function created and provide specific operations to solve the modulus of vector and inner product of two vectors. The expected value in the last task was achieved by implementing the operation vectors introduced in this laboratory and it was visualize using a 3D-plot.

### Activity 1 Flowchart

Figure above shows the flowchart of the function created that solves the modulus of a vector. A function named ‘modulus’ was defined first and it has a parameter ‘vec’ so that it can receive the value of the vector. When the values of vectors are created and were passed into the ‘vec’ of the ‘modulus’ function, the loop will be taking that values and it will perform the operations created inside the loop and the number of times it will execute the loop is based on the number of items in a created list of values or length of the vector. Afterward, the computed values will be returned and printed.

### Activity 2 Flowchart

The flowchart of the code for the function created that solves the inner product of the vectors using the inner product formula. The function was defined first and when the values of the pair of vectors were passed to the parameter of this function, these values will be used in the loop created that contains the operations to solve the inner product of the 2 vectors. The loop will continue looping until the elements of vectors were used and the result can be printed after the result from the loop was returned.

### Activity 3 Flowchart

Figure above shows the algorithm created to get the resulting vector of the 3 vectors by doing the operations on the given vectors. The creation of 3 array vectors given by the instructor was done first. The operations are sliced into 3 steps to easily visualize or to make the debugging on the program easier if the result doesn’t match the expected value of the resulting vector. Followed by arranging values to be used as scalar values and setting up the 3-dimensional plane. Lastly, it was plotted and shown at the same time with the resulting vector.
