The code snippet above executed to have an identical output to what has been presented in the given problem. It was achieved by using the function zip() to put together the two lists and convert it together into a string by using the join string method. Also, the word 'at level' was added in-between of the Pokémon names and level in the positional argument from the format string method so that when it prints, it will follow the format that was assigned which is the ("{} {} {}".format(party, ‘at level’, levels). So, the first index from the 'party', will go to the first ‘{}’ to be followed by the word ‘at level’ into the second ‘{}’ then lastly the first index from the ‘level’ list into last ‘{}’. This process is in a loop until it reached the last index of the list or ‘Abra’ and level 14 in the ‘levels’ list.
