## Multi-dimensional Vectors

This laboratory activity aims to implement the principles and techniques of representing multi-dimensional vectors or linear combinations in a 3-dimensional plane.

The practices of the activity include creating a system of a linear equation and representing it on a 3-dimensional plane. This teaches and implies the techniques for representing vectors using a different method of plotting in a 2D or 3D plane. The deliverables of the activity are to provide a system of a linear equation and scalar values for plotting on 2D and 3D planes. Moreover, it was achieved by creating an array of vectors and creating random values for scalars by using np.range() function that “return evenly spaced values within a given interval” [1]. The mathplotlib.pyplot.gca() function was used to get the current axes and project them in 3D [2]. For the creation of a figure object, the plt.figure() function was used [3] while plt.plot() was used to plot the vectors [4] and the plt.show() was used to show the plotted vectors on the plane [5].
